# Whitelist cache

The <u>whitelist cache</u> keeps track of previous whitelist entries that were 
removed due to the user no longer having a valid role or leaving the Discord server.

Once a player in the cache tries to join the server, the mod will add 
their entry back without any visible changes to the player.
